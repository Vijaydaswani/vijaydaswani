👋 Hi, I'm Vijay Daswani
Lead DevSecOps Engineer | Platform Architect | AI Automation Engineer | Multi-Cloud | Kubernetes | Blockchain Infra

I’m a multi-cloud DevSecOps + Platform Engineering specialist who loves building production-grade, automated, secure, and intelligent systems.
From Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions to AI Agents, Blockchain Infrastructure, and Security Engineering — I build end-to-end platforms that scale.

I also create content under Build & Automate, where I simplify AI, DevOps, Cloud, Infra, and Automation with humor, real examples, and powerful demos.

🚀 What I Actually Do (Advanced)
🧠 AI Automation & Agents

Build AI Agents for DevOps, Kubernetes, Infra, PR reviews, and Security

RAG + LangChain + APIs + automations

Intelligent CI/CD → automated fixes, architecture suggestions

AI-driven monitoring + anomaly alerts

Contract redlining + policy-driven review agents

⚙️ Platform Engineering

Design full platform layers: networking, security, infra, CI/CD, observability

Golden paths, paved road setups, developer self-service

GitOps with ArgoCD, Kustomize, multi-environment orchestration

Internal Dev Platforms for teams (AKS/GKE)

☁️ Cloud Engineering (Azure, GCP, AWS)

Landing Zones, Hub–Spoke, Private Links, VNet Peering

Enterprise security (IAM, RBAC, Policies, Compliance)

Scalable Kubernetes platforms for production

Cloud cost governance & optimization

🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform expert (modules, micro-modules, Terragrunt, Otofu workflows)

End-to-end infra automation pipelines

IaC testing (Terratest, Checkov), security gating

Refactoring legacy IaC → modern standards

🛡️ DevSecOps & Security Engineering

IaC scanning, secrets mgmt, supply-chain security

PR/GitOps security automation

DevSecOps frameworks and security guardrails

Policy-as-code, audit automation, SOX controls

🌀 Kubernetes Architecture

AKS, GKE engineering at scale

Node pools, autoscaling, security contexts, registries

Service mesh, ingress gateways, internal load balancers

Debugging complex cluster issues (CNI, Calico, IP exhaustion)

🧱 Blockchain Infrastructure

Besu, Quorum, IPFS, Graph Node

Smart contract infra automation

Monitoring + logging + alerting for blockchain clusters

One-click environments for dev teams

📊 Observability & Monitoring

Datadog deep expertise

Distributed tracing, logging pipelines

Cloud metrics, availability SLOs, dashboards

Performance tuning & reliability engineering

🔁 CI/CD, Automation & Tooling

GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins

PR pipelines, infra pipelines, release pipelines

Automated testing, build optimizations

Artifact versioning, package mgmt, SBOM

🧩 Core Philosophy

Build Smart. Automate Everything.
Make systems self-healing. Make developers faster. Make engineering fun.
